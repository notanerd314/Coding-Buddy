# Coding Buddy
#### Coding Buddy is a **pygame** application, designed for making the developer less bored.

Here's an example image of how it works:

# How to install

To use this program, you must install [**Python 3**](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and **pygame**.
To install **pygame**, open **Command Prompt** and type in:
```
python3 -m pip install -U pygame --user
```
If you couldn't, go to this [**website**](https://www.pygame.org/wiki/GettingStarted) for more help.

Then press the green **Code** button, and choose **Download ZIP file**. Next, extract the file and open the `coding-buddy.py` in the folder `Coding Buddy` file. If it's not running then you haven't installed pygame.

# How to customize
The `settings.ini` file is used for customizing **Coding Buddy**. Open it and then edit the settings.
> [!WARNING]
> This part if done wrong can result in **breaking** the program
>
> Proceed with **caution** while doing that step.

I won't explain how to edit `settings.ini` but you can find how to edit it [**here**](https://www.partitionwizard.com/partitionmanager/ini-file.html#:~:text=Since%20INI%20files%20are%20text,txt%20file%20first.).
