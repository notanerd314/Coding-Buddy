# Coding Buddy
Coding Buddy encourages you while programming. Ideal for intermediate programmers.

It says something in the title every 7 seconds, like `Typescript or Javascript?`

# How to install

To use this program, you must install [**Python 3**](https://www.python.org/downloads/). Because this application is

built opon **Python only**.

# How to use the application itself
To use it, simply open the file `coding-buddy.pyw` and just leave it alone in one place.

> [!WARNING]

# How to use the `settings.ini` file
To customize the Coding Buddy, use the `settings.ini` file.

### How to use it
In text file you should see this:
```ini
# DO NOT EDIT THE VARIABLE NAMES AND THOSE THINGS IN THE BRACKETS or the program will die

[BASIC SETTINGS]

# Use RGB color to determine what color you want to use for the text
# But don't put hashtags at the front of the hex code
Text_Color = 000000

# Change the text font displayed at the bottom
# If the font you choose doesn't exist then it will use the default font
Text_Font = Arial
...
```
So the variables (means `Text_Color`) are the names of the options

And to change the settings you have to edit the input (behind the `=`) to your defaults.
